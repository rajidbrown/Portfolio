    <h1>Shaded Motorworks</h1>
    <p>
    Shaded Motorworks is a full-stack web application that models how a real motorcycle repair shop operates. It centralizes scheduling, service records, and customer–mechanic workflows into a single role-based system for customers, mechanics, and administrators.
I designed and built the frontend, backend logic, and database from the ground up using Laravel and PHP. Authentication, permissions, scheduling, and data updates are handled server-side, while HTML and CSS power the interface. SQLite was used during development for rapid iteration, with a production-ready structure compatible with MySQL.

    <!-- CUSTOMER FLOW -->
    <h2>Customer Flow</h2>
    <p>
      Customers can book service and manage their bikes in one place. Instead
      of picking a specific mechanic, the system matches appointments based on
      availability and service type.
    </p>

    <!-- MECHANIC FLOW -->
    <h2>Mechanic Flow</h2>
    <p>
      Mechanics see only the jobs assigned to them, log diagnostics, and submit
      recommendations directly into the system. That data is saved to the
      database and immediately reflected on the customer side, creating a clean
      workflow from inspection to completion.

    <!-- ADMIN FLOW -->
    <h2>Administrator Access</h2>
    <p>
      Admins manage mechanics, schedules, and shop-wide appointments from a
      single dashboard. The system is built around role-based access so each
      user only sees what they need, keeping operations organized and secure.

    <h2>Under the Hood</h2>
      <p>
      Shaded Motorworks is built on Laravel’s MVC architecture, separating logic, data handling, and presentation for maintainability and scalability. Authentication is handled using Laravel’s session-based system with securely hashed passwords, and access throughout the app is governed by role-based permissions for customers, mechanics, and administrators.
      </p>

      <p>
      Scheduling is driven by availability logic that evaluates mechanic work hours, existing appointments, and service requirements to dynamically generate valid booking time slots. The system automatically matches appointments based on real availability, eliminating conflicts. 
      </p>

      <p>
      All service history, diagnostics, and recommendations are maintained in a relational database designed specifically for repair workflows. During development, SQLite allowed rapid iteration on schema and features, while the production structure is compatible with MySQL for real-world deployment. Blade templating helps establish a lightweight frontend layer, keeping my UI logic clean and replicable for later page additions.
